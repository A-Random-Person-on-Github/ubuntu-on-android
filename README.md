### A note before you try
- As lot of it is preinstalled you can login and start right after you install 
- And its in early stages of building so things may look kind of bad (make sure to notice me if you find any in issues)
- If you have any issues or suggestions make sure i know at https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/ubuntu-on-android/issue (create an issue)
