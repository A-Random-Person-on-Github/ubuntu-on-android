## Note & Disclaimer!

**A note before you try**
- As lot of it is preinstalled you can login and start right after you install.
- Before installation, be sure that you're on stable internet and your device have 5-6gb free space for neat installation.
- As this runs on termux and on software rendering so performence clearly depends on CPU, ram and storage read-write speed!
- Consider not to try heavy apps unless you got a good device.
- If you have any issues or suggestions make sure i know at https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/ubuntu-on-android/issue (create an issue)

**Disclaimer**
- I dont work with any company or organization of ubuntu or any third party sources took in making fs(for now).
- This project works by compliying to selinux android. and all aim of the project is just run linux on android without direct root with a twist and this project improves time by time with your support and motivation.
- the linux you trying to install from this repo is not fully functional in target space because of the selinux policies, and increasing requirement in linux requirements and also because project is set to run with `ptrace()` a low level access in android kernel
- Graphics performence is really bad cause proot and usage on VNC, we dont support any adoptation on improving it **for now** cause insufficient data on android (ping me in discord if you have any ideas or any codes on this) 
- **(Update)** see https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/ubuntu-on-android/wiki/XWayland-in-proot to run smooth and fast session
